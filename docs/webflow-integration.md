title: How to add the script to your Webflow site
---

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

You can use the "**[Custom Code](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-in-the-head-and-body-tags)**" feature to add Plausible Analytics tracking code to your Webflow website same way you would add Google Analytics code or any other JavaScript code. 

Site-wide JavaScript code injection is a premium Webflow feature so you need to upgrade your Webflow account to a paid subscription plan.

* In your "**Project settings**" click on "**Custom code**".

* Find the "**Head code**" section.

* Paste your Plausible tracking code in the "**Head code**" section and save changes.

Now you can go to your website and verify whether Plausible Analytics script has been added and to your Plausible Analytics account to see whether the stats are being tracked. See here [how to verify the integration](troubleshoot-integration.md).
