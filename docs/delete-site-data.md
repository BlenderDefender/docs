title: Delete your site data and your stats

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Within the "**Danger zone**" section of your website settings you can delete your site from Plausible Analytics. This also removes all the stats you've collected until that point. Click on the big red "**Delete**" button to delete your site and your stats from Plausible Analytics.

Permanently deleting all your data may take up to 48 hours and you won't be able to immediately register the same site again until the process is complete.
