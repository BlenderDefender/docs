Log in to your Plausible Analytics account and in the top right menu, click on your account name and choose "**Settings**" to enter your account settings.

To delete your Plausible Analytics account, find the "**Delete account**" section and click on the big red "**Delete my account**" button.

:::note
Deleting your account does not remove all the sites and stats you've collected. You should delete your site data within your site settings too before you delete your account. Here's [how to delete your sites and site data](delete-site-data.md).
