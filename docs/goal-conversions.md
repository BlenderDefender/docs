Goals and custom events are the actions that you want your visitors to take on your site. Actions such as signing up to a newsletter, clicking on a "**Download**" button, registering for a trial account, purchasing a product, clicking on an external link, downloading a file or completing a checkout form of an ecommerce store.

By setting up goals and custom events, you can track the number of conversions, conversion rate, referrer sources and entry pages that are driving conversions and the top pages that people convert on.

After setting up a goal, it will show up in the "**Goal Conversions**" section of your dashboard as soon as we record the first conversion. Then you can click on the particular goal to filter your dashboard by it and get all the insights on the traffic that has converted on that specific goal.

There are several types of goals in Plausible Analytics:

* [Pageview goals](pageview-goals.md) allow you to measure how many people visit a specific section of your site (for instance dynamically created ecommerce checkout pages can be grouped into one goal using this feature)
* [Custom event goals](custom-event-goals.md) allow you to measure button clicks, purchases, subscriptions, form completions, clicks on video or audio elements and pretty much any other action that you wish (you can also send custom dimensions alongside custom events for extra insights)
* [Outbound link clicks](outbound-link-click-tracking.md) allow you to automatically measure clicks on external links
* [File downloads](file-downloads-tracking.md) allow you to automatically track when a visitor clicks a link leading to a file
* [404 error pages](error-pages-tracking-404.md) allow you to automatically measure page not found errors
* We also have a way to automatically track clicks on [cloaked affiliate links and other pretty URLs](custom-automatic-link-tracking.md)
