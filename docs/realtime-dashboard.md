Plausible Analytics features a realtime view that tells you what's happening on your site live in that moment.

<img alt="Realtime dashboard" src={useBaseUrl('img/realtime-dashboard.png')} />

You can get to the realtime dashboard by clicking on the number of "**current visitors**" or by selecting "**Realtime**" in the date picker in the top right. You can also view the realtime dashboard by pressing the `R` key on your keyboard. 

The realtime dashboard will look familiar to you. ALl the same reports and metrics are there as in our default dashboard. You can also filter the realtime dashboard by any metric that you click on except for the goal conversions. The realtime dashboard is updated every 30 seconds so you donâ€™t have to refresh it to stay up to date.

In the top chart, you can see the number of current visitors (defined as those that visited your site in the last 5 minutes), the number of unique visitors in the last 30 minutes and the total number of page views in the last 30 minutes. In the graph itself, you can choose to either display the number of unique visitors or the number of page views in the last 30 minutes.

Top Sources, Top Pages, Locations and Devices reports all show the traffic in the last 5 minutes. The goal conversions themselves show the number of conversions in the last 30 minutes.
